<H2><A name=Knight>Knight's Tour</A></H2>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>The objective of this puzzle is to pass all the squares 
of the board with the knight, making only legal moves. A legal move for the 
knight is shaped like an L. Up or down two squares and over one square. The 
knight starts in a random position. Click on the square that you want to reach 
from there. It will be occupied by a new piece. Continue until the whole board 
is filled. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>If you get stuck, you can undo your moves one-by-one by 
using the undobutton. If you press the resetbutton you will go back to square 
one. To analyze the moves you made so far you can use the trace function. 
Pushing the tracebutton again will turn the trace function off. The new button 
will not only reset the board but also move the knight to a new starting 
position.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>This is an excellent puzzle that challenges both sides 
of the brain. While you attempt to following the rule of only using the L shaped 
moves in sequence, you also need to see a pattern developing on the board so 
that you don't get stuck in a corner, unable to move again.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>This is a difficult puzzle and few have managed to 
accomplish it, yet it is possible. In fact, once you have mastered hitting all 
the squares then you can tackle the challenge of hitting all the squares without 
ever crossing your path. Good luck!</STRONG></FONT></P>

<H2><A name=Pent><B>Pentominos</B></A></H2>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>The objective of this puzzle is to place all pentominos 
on the board after you have marked four squares to remain empty. To clear the 
board you push the button that says "begin". A grid will appear. In the grid 
click on four different squares. They will turn black. Then click on the 
pentomino of your choice, hold the mousebutton and drag it on the board. To 
remove a pentomino you can drag it over the edge - any edge - of the board and 
release it. Push (or hold) the right mousebutton to rotate; doubleclick to flip 
the pentomino.</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3><STRONG>This is an excellent exercise in visual spatial 
relationships and memory. Once you have accomplished it with the black squares 
in one place, then move the black the square around and try again. This puzzle 
exercises the right brain very effectively.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3><STRONG>The objective of this puzzle is to find 10 
words of the given sort. You can strike out words that you have recognized. If a 
word is correct, the line will remain and the counter will increase. Otherwise 
the line will disappear. This is an excellent exercise in left brain language 
searching skills. </STRONG></FONT></P>

<H2><A name=Pyramid>Pyramid Puzzle</A></H2>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3><STRONG>The pyramid puzzle is made up of anagrams, 
the length of which is each time increased with one new letter. The puzzle is 
typically solved from the top down. To select a new row the user can either 
click on it or use the up and down arrows on the keyboard. The puzzle works very 
much like a crossword puzzle. In the box below a clue will appear that describes 
the corresponding anagram. </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=3><STRONG>This is more difficult than it first 
appears. This is another good left brain exercise in language searching and 
rearranging letters to make new words, while following a defined 
sequence.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<H2>Rubik's Cube</H2>
<P><B>A famous recent puzzle is Rubik's cube invented by the Hungarian Ernö 
Rubik. Invented in 1974, patented in 1975 it was put on the market in Hungary in 
1977. It did not really begin it's infamous popularity until 1981. By 1982 10 
million cubes had been sold in Hungary, more than the population of the country. 
It is estimated that 100 million were sold world-wide. </P>
<P>The cube consists of 3 x 3 x 3 smaller cubes which are colored so that the 6 
faces of the large cube have 6 distinct colors. The 9 cubes forming one face can 
be rotated through 45 rotations. There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 different 
arrangements of the small cubes, only one of these arrangements being the 
initial position where all colors match on each of the six sides. </P>Solving 
this puzzle involves both sides of the brain as you must be able to previsualize 
spatially the final result while you remember where you've been in the sequence 
of rotations. Though a very difficult puzzle, it is a good exercise for brain 
flexing whether you accomplish the final result or not. <A

<H2>Peg Solitaire</H2>
<P><B>No one really knows when Peg solitaire was invented. Some stories trace it 
to prisoners during the French Revolution. Most likely the game is even older. 
There are probably variations in all cultures dating to antiquity. </P>Play is 
simple, yet challenging. Can you remove all the pegs in the least amount of 
time? Can you finish with only one peg in the target hole? This challenges both 
sides of the brain for as you spatially move around the board you need to 
remember which strategies you have used before. It utilizes both logical and 
analogical kinds of thought. <A

<P><A href="http://www.enchantedmind.com/newjava.htm#Top">Back to Top</A> </P>
<P><B>Rubik's Cube and Peg Solitaire java puzzles were created by Karl Hornell, 
a Swedish university student. He has a number of excellent java puzzles on his 
site. His site is worth viewing for more puzzles and interesting information 
about the language of java. <A href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~karl">Karl Hornell's

<H2>MASTER MIND</H2>
<P>Master Mind is an excellent exercise in logic while also using the intuition. 
The object is to discover a series of five numbers in ten attempts. The puzzle 
lets you know with each guess which numbers are correct and which are in the 
correct position in the sequence.Using deductive logic you can eliminate error 
with each new guess, but it also happens that after several guesses your 
subconscious allows you to see the completed number in your mind. This one 
puzzle is useful for using both sides of the brain.</P>
