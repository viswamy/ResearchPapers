 <!-- *** PIRATE TREASURE *** -->
<H2><FONT size=+4>S</FONT><I>olution for</I>: <FONT size=+4>P</FONT><I>irate</I> 
<FONT size=+4>T</FONT><I>reasure...</I> </H2><FONT size=+2>T</FONT>he idea 
behind the solution for this puzzle is that a pirate will accept a proposal only 
if he knows that in case he would not accept the proposal, he would get less of 
the treasure. 
<P><FONT size=+2>I</FONT>f pirate 1 would be the only one left, he would get all 
the golden coins. If only pirates 1 and 2 would be left, pirate 2 would die for 
sure, since pirate 1 is bloodthirsty and will reject all proposals of pirate 2 
(since he will get all coins anyway). So: <PRE>                  |  Pirate 1  |  Pirate 2
  ----------------+------------+------------
  Number of coins |    1000    |     0
  ----------------+------------+------------
  Pirate agrees   |    No      |    Yes
</PRE>
<P><FONT size=+2>W</FONT>hen also pirate 3 would still be alive, he needs the 
agreement of one of the other two. Pirate 2 will agree with every proposal 
since, as we have seen, he would die if he didn't. So pirate 3 should propose to 
keep everything for himself. <PRE>                  |  Pirate 1  |  Pirate 2  |  Pirate 3
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------
  Number of coins |     0      |     0      |    1000
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------
  Pirate agrees   |     No     |    Yes     |    Yes
</PRE>
<P><FONT size=+2>W</FONT>hen we have four pirates, pirate 4 should make two 
other pirates agree with his proposal. So he proposes to give one coin to pirate 
1, one coin to pirate 2, and the rest to himself. Pirates 1 and 2 will accept 
the proposal, since they are greedy, and if they wouldn't, they would get less. <PRE>                  |  Pirate 1  |  Pirate 2  |  Pirate 3  |  Pirate 4
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------
  Number of coins |     1      |     1      |     0      |    998
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------
  Pirate agrees   |    Yes     |    Yes     |     No     |    Yes
</PRE>
<P><FONT size=+2>B</FONT>ut as we know, there are five pirates. If pirate 5 
gives both pirate 1 (or 2) and pirate 3 one coin more than in the previous case, 
they are willing to accept the proposal. Then a majority (three out of five) of 
the pirates will support the proposal, and pirate 5 can keep the rest of the 
treasure to himself. <PRE>                  |  Pirate 1  |  Pirate 2  |  Pirate 3  |  Pirate 4  |  Pirate 5
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------
  Number of coins |     2      |     0      |     1      |     0      |    997
  ----------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------
  Pirate agrees   |    Yes     |     No     |    Yes     |     No     |    Yes
</PRE><FONT size=+2>C</FONT>onclusion: Pirate 5 should propose to give two coins 
to pirate 1 (or 2), one coin to pirate 3, and the remaining 997 coins to 
himself.<BR><BR><A
