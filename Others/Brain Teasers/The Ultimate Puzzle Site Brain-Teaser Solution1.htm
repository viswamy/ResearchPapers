<H2><FONT size=+4>S</FONT><I>olution for</I>: <FONT size=+4>A</FONT> <FONT 
size=+4>Q</FONT><I>uiz...</I> </H2><FONT size=+2>I</FONT>n this puzzle, you 
should <I>not</I> use your intuition, but let your common sense do the job: 
<BR>The chance that your first choice for a door was correct is 1/3; therefore, 
the chance that your first choice was wrong is 2/3. <BR>So the chance that one 
of the remaining doors is correct is also 2/3. <BR>With the help of the 
quizmaster (who knows which door hides the price, and thus is able to open one 
of the remaining doors which does not contain the the price), you get to know 
which one of the remaining doors is incorrect. Now you also know which one of 
the remaining doors could be correct with a chance of 2/3! <BR><BR><FONT 
size=+2>C</FONT>onclusion: You should switch doors, which doubles your 
chances!... <BR><BR><FONT size=+2>F</FONT>or the disbelieving few: consider the 
situation where there are 1000 doors instead of 3. After you have chosen one 
door, the quizmaster points out 998 of the 999 doors that are left, that do not 
contain the prize. Should you switch to the other remaining door? Of course! If, 
out of 999 doors, the quizmaster (contiously) leaves that door, chances are very 
large (999/1000) that it is the right one!<BR><BR><FONT size=+2>F</FONT>or the 
still disbelieving few: write a computer program which simulates this quiz 
thousands of times, and you will see the that the chances are double if you 
switch doors!... <A href="http://www.dse.nl/puzzle/logical/index.html#quiz"><IMG
